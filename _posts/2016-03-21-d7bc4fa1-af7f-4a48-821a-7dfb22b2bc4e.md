Our Mission: We're convinced we are meant to live for something more than ourselves. Lasting fulfillment comes from connecting to a purpose deeper and bigger than power, position or possessions. Jesus laid it out for his followers: glorify God by making disciples. 
That's why we're here - that's our mission. And it's bigger than anything else we know. If that sounds about right to you, then this might be a great place to land.
